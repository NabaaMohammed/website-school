                                        Our nursery’s main goal is to help our students to develop their intellectual and social skills in an environment that is fun and that they feel safe and secure in. While doing so we also aim to create a positive outlook and desire to learn that will last all through their education. During this time, while teaching the students to adjust to new situations, we also teach them how and when to meet their needs of personal development, using methods that stimulate the child in an effective and fun way.
During this critical period the most important thing is to develop the student’s basic skills. Our teachers have been trained to teach in many methods to bring all skills to the best of their potential. As it should be, any achievements of our students are praised and rewarded in an appropriate manner. With this in mind we have one  teacher and one assistant in class at all time watching and interacting with the students. While planning and designing our facilities we have kept in mind the needs of the students and how the facilities will help them develop their intellectual, physical, social and emotional skills. Understanding and support are fundamentals to our disciple system that will help the students to understand the importance of appropriate behaviour
